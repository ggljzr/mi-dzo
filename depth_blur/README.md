# Usage

* Arrows -- move depth selector
* Space -- apply box filter
* Enter -- apply bilateral filter
* Alt -- switch between image and depth map display
* S -- save image in ``res.png``
* Esc -- exit

# Dataset

[Middlebury dataset](http://vision.middlebury.edu/stereo/) is nice collection of images with depth maps.

# Alternative implementation

Alternative implementation in Scala is [here](https://github.com/ggljzr/mi-psl). It has more comfortable GUI, however it will probably be slower than this version.
